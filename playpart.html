        ACT FIRST.
        
          A plainly-furnished work-room in the house of HALVARD SOLNESS.
          Folding doors on the left lead out to the hall.  On the right
          is the door leading to the inner rooms of the house.  At the
          back is an open door into the draughtsmen's office.  In front,
          on the left, a desk with books, papers and writing materials.
          Further back than the folding door, a stove.  In the right-
          hand corner, a sofa, a table, and one or two chairs.  On the
          table a water-bottle and glass.  A smaller table, with a
          rocking-chair and arm-chair, in front on the right.  Lighted
          lamps, with shades, on the table in the draughtmen's office,
          on the table in the corner, and on the desk.
        
          In the draughtsmen's office sit KNUT BROVIK and his son RAGNAR,
          occupied with plans and calculations.  At the desk in the outer
          office stands KAIA FOSLI, writing in the ledger.  KNUT BROVICK
          is a spare old man with white hair and beard.  He wears a
          rather threadbare but well-brushed black coat, with spectacles,
          and a somewhat discoloured white neckcloth.  RAGNAR BROVIK is
          a well-dressed, light-haired man in his thirties, with a
          slight stoop.  KAIA FOSLI is a slightly built girl, a little
          over twenty, carefully dressed, and delicate-looking.  She has
          a green shade over her eyes.--All three go on working for some
          time in silence.
